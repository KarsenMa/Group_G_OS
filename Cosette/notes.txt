Define parent and child process
parent begins in main, should a separate function be declared for child process? 
Parent process acts as the server to respond to messages. 
Parent process models resource allocation table as a graph? 


Trains are child process
Child process should hold train and path information
Child process will then use the message queue to acquire and release semaphore or mutex locks depending on the intersection
Child process follows route defined when created.

child process will need to call some kind of sync function that uses semaphore and mutex from IPC


Resource allocation table
Needs to dynamically size the max number of trains and intersections similar to semaphore and mutex logic
Needs to hold the lock state of the intersection (from the mutex and semaphore values)
Needs to hold intersection ID
Needs to know the type of intersection (logic already included in main for this)
Needs to hold an array of strings that is max size the capacity of the intersection 

Resource allocation graph
Needs to track resource allocation to watch for deadlock

Update traincommunication to check semaphore and mutex
